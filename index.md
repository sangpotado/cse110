## Sang Do Introduction

**Things I like to do:** watching my mind struggling with coming up solutions for some problems, eating, sleeping, hiking, martial art

**Recent _favorite_ quote:**  
>“The answer always seemed obvious to me: there is no threshold that makes us greater than the sum of our parts, no inflection point at which we become fully alive. We can’t define consciousness because consciousness does not exist. Humans fancy that there’s something special about the way we perceive the world, and yet we live as loops as tight and as closed as the hosts, seldom questioning our choices, content for the most part to be told what to do next. No, my friend, you’re not missing anything at all.” 
Dr. Ford from WestWorld

**My daily life as described in code:**

```
random_activities = [visit_museums, play_with_animals, read_books, hike, swim, watch_movies, dance]
daily_activities = [CSE, martial_art, walk, breath]

while alive:
    for activity in daily_activities:
        agent.do(activity)
    agent.eat(food)         # the argument should always be "food"
    agent.avoid(social_interaction)

    if days % 7 == 0:
       agent.call(family)   # 
       agent.do(random_activities[random_int])

    agent.sleep(10)         # the only healthy way to escape reality
    days += 1

```
